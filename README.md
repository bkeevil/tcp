# TCP

A TCP client/server library for Linux and that uses the C++ iostream interface.

## Documentation

I used Doxygen to embed the documentation in the code. Once Doxygen is installed on your system, 
go to the repository root type `doxygen` to generate the documentation.
It is placed in the docs\ directory.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/bkeevil/tcp.git

cd tcp

mkdir build

cd build

cmake ..

make
```
