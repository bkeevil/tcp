# Overview

A TCP client/server library for Linux and that uses the C++ iostream interface.

## Documentation

I used Doxygen to embed the documentation in the code. Once Doxygen is installed on your system,
go to the repository root type `doxygen` to generate the documentation.
Documentation is generated to the docs\ directory.

## Installation

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/bkeevil/tcp.git
cd tcp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
